## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: White screen on LOVABLE
**Solution:** The HashRouter in `src/main.jsx` automatically detects LOVABLE and uses hash-based routing. This is already implemented!

### Issue: Assets not loading
**Solution:** Fixed by setting `base: './'` in `vite.config.js`

### Issue: 404 on page refresh
**Solution:** Fixed by adding `public/_redirects` file

### Issue: API calls failing
**Solution:** Set proper environment variables in LOVABLE project settings:
- `VITE_OMH_API_BASE`
- `VITE_AUTORL_API_BASE`
